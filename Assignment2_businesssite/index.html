  <h2>Safety Through Communication</h2>

  <p>From falls at home to a pandemic - fast, direct communication is absolute key if you need help, information, or reassurance.&nbsp; <br><br>Connecting people to each other, their nearest first responders, their loving family and friends, their workplace, and even their doctorâ€™s office, ASPECT is an emergency response and public safety platform like no other in the industry today.<br><br></p></span>

  <h2>Expedited, Streamlined Emergency Response</h2>

  <p>ASPECT is an untethered, decentralized emergency response and public safety ecosystem that uses the power of "people on the ground" to improve the speed and quality of emergency event responses and drastically decrease panic, fear, and uncertainty that people feel during personal and large-scale emergency events.  

<br><br>As a First Responder, you want an accurate view of the situation as soon as an emergency occurs.  Stop relying on information gathered years ago and get data directly from people whoa are on the ground.

<br><br>As someone involved in an an incident or an emergency, you want First Responders to know exactly where you are, how you're doing, and if you need any help.  In an emergency - letting people know whether or not you're safe can mean the difference between life and death.

  <h2>Personal Safety and Peace of Mind</h2>

  <p>At this time, very few people have a way to directly interact with responders during an emergency.  This tends to cause panic, fear, uncertainty, doubt, confusion, and even anger within people, their families, and their loved ones.<br><br>

ASPECT focuses on how people act, feel, and think during emergency events by combining principles from social and organizational psychology, game theory, human-computer interaction, machine learning, and many other disciplines with ties to public safety.<br><br></p></span>

  <h2>Quick and Easy Issue Reporting</h2>

  <p>From health and food safety to regular maintenance - safety is not just about guards and fences.  And, especially in these times, it is everyone's responsibility.<br><br>

By knowing, addressing, and reporting the status of your surroundings , everyone in your community or organization can become safer and more secure.
